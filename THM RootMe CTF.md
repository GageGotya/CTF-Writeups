# üéØ TryHackMe - RootMe Writeup

## üìã Challenge Overview
**Platform**: TryHackMe  
**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Category**: Web Exploitation, File Upload Bypass, Privilege Escalation  
**Target**: Linux machine with web application  
**Objective**: Gain root access and capture the flag

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- **Reconnaissance**: Nmap, Gobuster, Nikto
- **Web Testing**: Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP
- **File Upload Testing**: Custom scripts, manual testing
- **Privilege Escalation**: LinPEAS, manual enumeration
- **Shell Access**: Netcat, reverse shells

---

## üéØ Attack Path
1. **Initial Reconnaissance** - Port scanning and service enumeration
2. **Web Application Testing** - Directory enumeration and vulnerability assessment
3. **File Upload Exploitation** - Bypassing upload restrictions
4. **Initial Access** - Gaining shell access through file upload
5. **Privilege Escalation** - Escalating to root user
6. **Flag Capture** - Locating and capturing the final flag

## üìù Detailed Walkthrough

### Step 1: Initial Reconnaissance
```bash
# Port scan to identify open services
nmap -sC -sV -p- 10.10.x.x

# Results:
# 22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3
# 80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.29
```

### Step 2: Web Application Enumeration
```bash
# Directory enumeration
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.x.x -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

# Results:
# /panel/ - Directory found
# /uploads/ - Directory found
```
